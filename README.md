# Memory Game Project


This is the 3rd project from the Web Developer nanodegree program at Udacity.
The goal of this project is to create a Memory Game. 

How to play:
The game starts once the page is loaded and the timer starts. At the beginning of the game, all cards are flipped over (no images are shown) and the player has to open two cards (one card at a time).
If the image on both cards match, the cards will shake and turn to green color, otherwise, the cards will flip over and hide the image.
The game ends when the player finds all the matches.

Performance:
The performance is measured by the star rating. At the beginning of the game, the player has 3 star. After 20 moves, the player loses a star and then after 28 moves, the player has only one star left.

Restart:
The player can restart the game at any time just by pressing the restart button. The restart button will reset the number of moves, star rating and timer.

End of the game:
At the end of the game, a modal popup will show the number of moves, how long the player  took to finish the game and the star rating. The player can choose either to play a new game or leave the game.
