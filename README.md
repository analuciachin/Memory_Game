# Memory Game Project


This is the 3rd project from the Web Developer nanodegree program at Udacity.
The goal of this project is to create a Memory Game. It was already provided to us
some HTML and CSS styling to display a static version. We had to convert the static project to an interactive one by modifying primarily the Javascript file and the HTML and CSS as well.
